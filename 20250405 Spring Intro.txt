A framework is a semi-developed software structure that provides reusable components, libraries, and tools to support the development of applications.

Spring is an application development framework

UI Layer -> Web Layer -> Service Layer -> Persistance Layer -> DB 
*) Spring is open Source Framework
*)By Spring spring we can develop end to end application
*)Spring is versatile, cz we can develop even half application in spring and half by any other framework
*)Spring dont force to implement or extends any class/interface so we can say that spring is non Invasive framework
*)Spring is loosely coupled framework. It is developed in modular fashion.

Spring Core : It is a base module for spring framework. This module providing fundamental concepts of spring they are IOC and DI.
       IOC: Inversion Of Control
       DI : Dependency Injection

Sprig context module will take care of configuration required in our applications.

Sprig AOP(Aspect-Oriented Programming) is used seperate business logic and secondary logic in our application. Just like db logic or security logic we write in seperate class. 

DB -> Spring App(DAO -> Service -> Controller) -> UI	   

Spring DAO(Datavase Access Object) / Spring JDBC module is used to developed persistance layer(logic which is used communicate with database). It is developed on top of JDBC Api.
