=> Database is a software which is used to store the data permanentley

	Ex: Oracle, MySQL,  SQLServer, PostGresSQL

=> To work with database we need to install Database software

=> Database Server software will store the data in the form of tables, rows and columns

=> Database Client software is used to communicate with Database Server Software

										
									SQL 
			DataBase client -----------------------------------> Database Server

Note: SQL (Structured Query Language) queries will be used to communicate Database Server


=> To communicate with Oracle DB server we can use "SQL Developer" as a client software

=> To communicate with MySQL DB server we can use "MySQL Workbench" as a client software

Note: SQL Developer  & MySQL Workbench softwares are used to execute SQL queries


========================
for basic understanding
========================

MySQL
------ 
MySQL is currently the most popular database management system software used for 
managing the database.  
It is open-source database software which is supported by Oracle Company.  
It is fast, scalable and easy to use database management system. 
For manipulating data, these queries are: insert records, update records, delete 
records, select records, create tables, drop tables, etc.  

Database 
--------
A database is an application that stores the organized collection of records.  
It can be accessed and manage by the user very easily.  
It allows us to organize data into tables, rows, columns, and indexes to find the 
relevant information very quickly.  
Each database contains distinct API for performing database operations such as 
creating, managing, accessing, and searching the data it stores. 
There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, 
PostgreSQL, etc. 

How MySQL Works? 
----------------
MySQL follows the working of Client-Server Architecture.  
This model is designed for the end-users called clients to access the resources from a 
central computer known as a server using network services.  
Here, the clients make requests through a graphical user interface (GUI), and the 
server will give the desired output as soon as the instructions are matched.

=============
Primary Key- 
============

MySQL primary key is a single or combination of the field, which is used to 
identify each record in a table uniquely. 
It cannot be null or empty.  
It can contain only one primary key.  
It always contains unique value into a column. 

Rules- 
------
1. The primary key column value must be unique. 
2. Each table can contain only one primary key. 
3. The primary key column cannot be null or empty. 

2. Foreign Key- 
==============
The foreign key is used to link one or more than one table together. It is also 
known as the referencing key.  
A foreign key matches the primary key field of another table. It means a foreign 
key field in one table refers to the primary key field of the other table. 

=============Student-Course Realtion===========

Course_table			
courseId(PK)	name	price 	duration
	1			java	5000		5
	2			python	4000		4
	3			aws		3000		2

student_table			
studId(PK)	name	college	   age	courseId(PK)
	101		akash	  abc		18		1
	102		virat	  xyz		17		2
	103		akash	  psq		20		3
	104		tom		  abc		20		3
	105		harry	  xyz		21		1


=====
JDBC
======
=>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API that allows Java applications to interact with relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.

=> JDBC API released by Sun Microsystem
=> Using JDBC API we can communicate with Database software using Java Program
=> JDBC API will act as mediator between Java Program and Database software
								
								JDBC API
			Java Program ----------------------------------> Database Server

=> JDBC API contains set of interfaces & classes

=> Database Software vendors provided implementation for JDBC API. As part of JDBC API implementation they provided Database Driver

JDBC Driver 
===========
->A software component that enables Java applications to communicate with the database.

Note: Every Database software having its own Driver.
		
				Oracle Database ------------> OracleDriver
				MySQL Database ----------> MySQL Driver
				SQL Server ------------------> SQLDriver

Note: Driver is a program which knows how to connect with Database Software.

=> Database Driver software released as jar file
		
			MySQL Driver ===========> mysql-connector.jar
			Oracle Driver ==========> ojdbc14.jar

Note: We need to download that jar file and add to project build path.
