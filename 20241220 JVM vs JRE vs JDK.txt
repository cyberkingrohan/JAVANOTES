Welcome to NSA IT-POINT

Today is 4th Session of Java Full stack Development 


1) Download and Install Java Software

		- JDK (Java Development Kit)
		- JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE & JVM ?

		- JDK contains set of tools to develop java programs
		- JRE providing a platform to run our java programs
		- JVM will take care of program execution
========
JVM
========

-> JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine (We can't see with our eyes)

-> JVM will be part of JRE

-> JVM is responsible for executing java programs

-> JVM will allocate memory required for program execution & de-allocate memory when it is not used

-> JVM will convert byte code into machine understandable format


================
JVM Architecture
===============

1) Class loader subsystem : It will load .class file into JVM

2) Method Area   : Class code will be stored here

3) Heap area : Objects will be stored into heap area

4) Java Stack : Method execution information will be stored here

5) PC Register : It will maintain next line information to execute

6) Native Stack : It will maintain non-java code execution information

7) Execution Engine   ( Interpreter + JIT ) : It is responsible to execute the program and provide output/result

8) Native Interface : It will load native libraries into jvm

9) Native Libraries : Non-java libraries which are required for native code execution
