Programs :
1)Write a java program to check given year is a leap year or not
2)Write a program to find the largest and smallest digits in a number.
3)Write a program to calculate the sum of the first n prime numbers using a while loop inside a for loop.
4)Write a program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number (e.g., 153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³).
5)Write a program to find the sum of digits of a number using a while loop (e.g., for 123, output = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6).
6)Write a program to reverse a number using a while loop (e.g., for 123, output = 321).
7)Write a program to find the factorial of a given number using a do-while loop.
8)Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to n terms using a for loop.
