===========
Identifiers
==========

-> All java components requires a name

-> For variables, for classes and for methods we need a name

			int age ;

			class Hello {
				// code 
			}

			main ( ) {
				//logic
			}


-> The name which we are using for packages, variables, classes  & methods is  called as identifier

-> We can use any name for identifiers but we need to follow below rules to work with identifiers

Rule-1 : Java will allow only below charaters for identifiers

				1) a - z
				2) A - Z
				3) 0 to 9
				4) $ (dollar)
				5) _ (underscore)

		Ex:

				name   -----> valid
				name@ -----> invalid
				age#   ------> invalid

Rule-2  : Identifier should not start with digit (first character shouldn't be digit)

				1age --------> invalid
				age2  ------> valid				
				name3  -----> valid
				_name -----> valid
				$name ------> valid
				@name ------> invalid
				$_amt   --------> valid
				_1bill -----------> valid

Rule-3 :  Java reserved words shouldn't be used as identifier   (53 reserved words)

					int byte = 20;    -------> invalid bcz byte is a reserved word

					byte for = 25;   -------> invalid bcz for is a reserved word

					int try = 30; 	------> invalid bcz try is a reserved word

					long phno = 797979799 -----> valid
			

Rule-4 : Spaces are not allowed in identifiers

				int mobile bill = 400;   // invalid

				int mobile_bill = 400 ;   // valid


Rule-5 : Java is case sensitive language 'name' & 'NAME' both are not same


==============================================
Java Naming Conventions  ( Java Coding Standards )
===============================================

-> Java language followed some standards/conventions for pre-defined packages, classes and methods....

-> Java language suggested java programmers also to follow same standards / conventions

-> Following these standards/conventions is not mandatory but highly recommended.

===============================
Naming Convention For Class Name
===============================

-> A class name can contain any no.of words without spaces
-> Recommended to write every word first character as uppercase in class name

Examples:

class Hello  {
}

class HelloWorld {
}

class UserManagementService{
}

class WelcomeRestController {
}

Note: Class Names & Interface Names conventions are same.

=========================
Variables Naming Convention
=========================

-> Variable name can have any no.of words without spaces

-> Recommended to start variable name with lowercase letter

-> If variable name contains multiple words then recommended to write firstword all characters in lowercase and from second word onwards every word first character in Uppercase

Examples:

int age ;

int  userAge;

long creditCardNumber ;

=========================
Method Naming Convention
=========================

> Method name can have any no.of words without spaces

-> Recommended to start method name with lowercase letter

-> If method name contains multiple words then recommended to write firstword all characters in lowercase and from second word onwards every word first character in Uppercase

main ( )  {
}

save ( ) {

}

saveUser( ) {

}

getWelcomeMsg ( ) {

}


Note: Variables & Methods naming conventions are same. But methods will have parenthesis ( () ) variables will not have parenthesis.


==============================
Naming Conventions for Constants
=============================

-> Constant means fixed value (value will not change, it is fixed)

-> Recommended to write constant variable all characters in uppercase

-> If constant variable contains multiple words recommended to use _ (underscore) with all uppercase characters


		final int MIN_AGE = 21;

		final int MAX_AGE = 60 ;

		int PI = 3.14;


===============================
Naming Conventions for Packages
==============================

-> Package name can have any no.of characters & any of words

-> Recommended to use only lowercase letters in package names

-> If package name conatins multiple words then we will use . (dot) to seperate words
